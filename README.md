### Work Examples:

#### [TDMP Media Scheduling System](https://tdmpreservations.netlify.app/)
The TDMP Media Scheduling System is a web application designed to manage media production equipment rentals. 
It streamlines inventory management, reservations, and account management for both staff and students. 
Built using Maven Spring for the backend and secured with Spring Security, using JWT tokens and password 
encryption, it leverages a MariaDB database for data storage and React.js for the frontend.

Skills Used: JS, Java, MariaDB, SQL, Spring, React

#### [Video Coach](#private-repo "Sorry, this repository is private. Please contact the author if interested.")
Leveraging computer vision and modular design, I developed a real-time exercise coaching system that 
processes posture detection and delivers corrective measures. The architecture 
implements sequential classification (position (front/left/right) → exercise) with a singleton-driven UI and factory 
patterns that dynamically adjust exercise tracking logic - including repetition counting and 
conditional triggers that control the start/stop functionality of the cooldown timer. This approach 
maintains precise form monitoring while allowing for flexible workout customization through its adaptable pipeline.

Skills Used: Python, OpenCV, Object-Oriented Design, Design Patterns, Performance Optimization

#### [Coke Freestyle Machine](https://github.com/Cetykon/Freestyle-Machine-Solution)
A recreation of the Coke Freestyle Machine interface and operations, created with the purpose of 
learning the .NET framework. This application simulates the user experience of selecting and customizing drinks, 
showcasing a touchscreen UI and backend functionality for drink mixing and selection.

Skills Used: C#, MSSQL, .NET

#### [Workout Webapp](https://github.com/Cetykon/WorkOut)
Workout tracker app using technologies such as MariaDB, Java, JavaScript, and Spring. 
Currently, users can add different workouts to plan their weekly workout routine, as well as create 
custom ones. A total of 10 CRUD APIs exist to give the front end its functionality.
##### (NOTICE: Currently, the system is being updated to use NoSQL and JSPs have been implemented for modularity.)

Skills Used: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, Bootstrap, MariaDB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

#### [Book Recommendations App](https://github.com/Cetykon/KNN-Book-Recommendation)
Using the KNN Machine Learning algorithm, my two teammates and I are creating a book recommendation app. 
I personally oversee the back end, which is entirely built in Python. 
The back end receives a list of books the user has read to provide recommendations for similar books. 

Skills Used: Python, Flask, React, ML

#### [IEP Meeting Webapp](https://github.com/powerm17/IEP_Chatbot_Frontend)
The chatbot simulates an IEP conversation between a teacher and a parent. 
Parent personality, and meeting reason are paramater that can be choosen. The 
front end, built with React, connects to two Python APIs that interface with the GPT API. 

Skills Used: Python, Flask, React, Prompt Engineering

#### Autodesk 3ds Max (3D Modeling & Animation)
In 3ds Max, I created a meticulously crafted chess setup featuring a detailed board, pieces, 
and a classic pedestal table with two chairs. Each element was carefully textured, 
and I used smooth camera movements to animate the scene, showcasing the chess set from all angles. 
The lighting and shadows add depth, highlighting the quality and realism of the model and textures, 
making the scene feel dynamic and immersive.
